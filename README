See the Wiki for how to use the CLM and the features on offer. 

To build your own, ncl_plist_header and ncl_plist_footer and create_plist.sh are the neccessary files.  This will create funclist and proclist from the ncl website using a combination of grep/sed/awk to parse the html file.  These may not be universal to your machine. 

NCL.plist is then created via a 
cat ncl_plist_header.txt funclist.txt reslist.txt ncl_plist_footer.txt > NCL.plist
